            <p>The Sabarmati River is a monsoon-fed river that flows north-south through Ahmedabad, bisecting the city into its western and eastern halves. It has been an integral aspect of Ahmedabad city since its foundation. Initially, the river was the city’s prime source of water. Today, water is supplied from many distant sources. Nonetheless, the river continues to be important. It has provided space for cultural and recreational activities along the banks. Mahatma Gandhi set-up his ashram along the banks of the river and during the freedom movement, the Salt March began from here. The wide, oft-dry riverbed and riverbanks were used more extensively to launder clothes and to dye textiles. During the dry seasons, the river bed was used for farming. It also became a venue for other informal economic activities such as the ‘Ravivari’- Sunday flea market. Gradually, many of the city’s migrant and poor population began to live in informal settlements on the river banks.</p></td>

                    The project devotes around seventy hectares, more than a quarter (26%), of the reclaimed land towards creating public spaces in the heart of the city. These open spaces range from public parks and gardens to shaded plazas and urban forests. The parks shall enhance livability in the neighbourhoods and provide the city with much needed green spaces and respite from the dense built environment. The plazas on the other hand will offer public places for social gatherings, and informal activities to take place.</p>

                 The SRFD streets have been designed carefully and deliberately to serve as effective movement conduits for various users and to be an extension of the public realm.
                   
                The SRFD streets run parallel to the river on both banks and provide continuous access to the riverfront development. Access streets at key locations connect the SRFD streets to the rest of the city.

                    Sabarmati river has been an integral part in the life of Ahmedabad since the time the city was founded in 1411 along the river banks. Besides being an important source of water, it provided a backdrop to cultural and recreational activities. During the dry seasons, the river bed became a place for farming. With time it also offered place for various informal economic activities</p>

                <p>The Riverfront project creates a public edge along the river on the eastern and western banks. By channeling the river to a constant width of 263m, riverbed land of 204.91 hetares has been reclaimed. The public riverfront extends up to a length of 11.25 kilometers within the city on either banks.</p>

The SRFDCL was provided with a seed capital of Rs. 9 crore and entrusted with the responsibility of developing the riverfront on a Build, Maintain, Operate and Transfer (BMOT) basis. The SPV model was used to avoid the delays associated with municipal decision-making. Riverbed land, which was originally held by the Government of Gujarat, was transferred to the AMC. AMC has, in turn, granted development rights to SRFDCL for this reclaimed land.</P></td>
